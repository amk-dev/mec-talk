6. run command `git checkout -b yourname`
7. update people.txt with your name
8. `git add people.txt`
9. `git commit -m "added name"`
10. now before being able to push to my repo, you need to fork it
11. to fork go to github.com/amk-dev/mec-talk and click fork, follow the steps
12. this will create a forked version (copy) of mec-talk
13. now this is your repo and you need to tell git to push stuff to this fork.
14. `git push my-remote yourname` should do the trick
